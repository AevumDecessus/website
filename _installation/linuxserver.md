If you prefer to run [Linuxserver.io](https://linuxserver.io/) images, you can install their
Manyfold image instead of our own official images.

{:.important}
Note that Linuxserver don't support any 32-bit architectures any more, in particular `armhf`, so
if you want to run on an older Raspberry Pi or similar hardware, use our official images.

To use their image, see [Linuxserver's own installation instructions](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-manyfold/).
