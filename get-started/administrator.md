Now you've got Manyfold up and running, the first task is to set up your administrator account.

If you're running in single-user mode, you won't need to use the details as you'll be automatically
logged in, but if you want to use multiuser mode, you'll have to use them to log in.

You'll need to set:

* an email address for account reset mails
* a username if you don't want to use the randomly generated one
* a strong password; there are no specific format rules, but it will be rejected if not strong enough. We recommend the [correct horse battery staple](https://www.correcthorsebatterystaple.net/index.html) method.
