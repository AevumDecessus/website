Some people have had success with this method, though it's not yet officially supported. Our own proper documentation for running on Synology will come along in the future!

{: .important }
NOTE: Your Synology NAS will need to be running Kernel 4.x or higher; the app will not start on kernel version 3. See the "Outdated Synology NAS Kernel under Version 4" section of [Mariushosting's troubleshooting guide](https://mariushosting.com/synology-common-docker-issues-and-fixes) for more info.

Many people have used Manyfold on their Synology NAS servers, and some have written articles on how to do it:

* Mariushosting has written [a very comprehensive guide](https://mariushosting.com/how-to-install-manyfold-on-your-synology-nas/).
* Andy Piper has shared some details of his experience on [his website](https://andypiper.co.uk/2023/07/05/running-a-3d-print-catalogue-with-van-dam/).
