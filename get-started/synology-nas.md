Some people have had success with this method, though it's not yet officially supported.

Many people have used Manyfold on their Synology NAS servers. Andy Piper has shared some details of how he did it on [his website](https://andypiper.co.uk/2023/07/05/running-a-3d-print-catalogue-with-van-dam/).
