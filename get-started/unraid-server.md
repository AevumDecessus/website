Some people have had success with this method, though it's not yet officially supported. Improved documentation will come along in the future!

Manyfold is available via the [Unraid Community Apps plugin](https://unraid.net/community/apps), currently under its old name "van_dam". For detailed instructions, install the CA plugin and search on the apps tab.

If you have any problems, take a look at the open [feature request](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/issues/451) for suggestions, or add your own experiences.
